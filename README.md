This is a school project we were assigned at Bellarmine University in our Software engineering (CS-400) class. It's our final portfolio of a project we have been working on since the beginning of the semester. We have learned a lot about different software development and engineering principles as well as methodologies in the lectures and we have used this throughout the semester to work on our very own software development project.

There were 4 phases of this project, in the first phase we had to come up with our software idea and then creat an actual physical box. This box was supposed to resemble a product that you could buy in a regular store. We also created a journal describing our ideas for functions, names and whom are target customers could be. The pictures of our box as well as the journal can be found in the design_documents folder by clicking on the several box pictures and the journal under the name: Software Engineering Assignment 1.pdf.

The second phase was about features, scenarios, personas and user stories. A nice way to get a better idea of what features should be included in a software product is to pretend to have some fake users, in other words, personas, with their own personal situations, needs and wants. From this the developers, us in this case, can get a better idea of the target users' perspectives. Quite frankly, stepping into the users shoes. The pdf containing our personas, features, user stories and scenarios may be found in the design_documents under the name: Software_Engineering_Assignment_2_EBB_DL.pdf.

In the third phase it was almost time to start making the actual product, but first we had to come up with a design for the software architecture as well as figuring out which technologies and services we would use. This pdf may be found in design_documents under the name: architectural_design_LesChevaliers.pdf.

The last and final phase we worked on making a functioning prototype of the product so that a user could an understanding of the main functions of the product and get a feel of the actual application and gui. We used some unit testing techniques and got a feel for docker to containarize the product for easier running. You may find the code for the prototype in the prototype folder.

Note: The prototype provided is not a complete application as it was all we managed to get done in the time granted to us, however, we are planning on working more on it in the future, so there might be updates to come.
